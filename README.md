# porfolio_manager
A CLI tool to help me manage my investment portfolio. I simply want something more flexible than just a spreadsheet. 

* Add asset
* Add target percentage by asset
* Add funds
* Save to sqlite or json on local storage 
* Api requests to query asset share price in real time, if no public api available, create a web scrapper.
* Rebalancing tool for asset rebalancing when buying
* Rebalancing when selling
* Should have functionality similar to M1 Finance pie feature: https://m1.com/invest/what-is-a-pie/#:~:text=Pies%20are%20the%20building%20blocks%20of%20M1%20portfolios.,you%20visualize%20and%20drive%20toward%20long-term%20financial%20goals.
* Add Gui in the foreseeable features
